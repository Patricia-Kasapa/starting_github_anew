Hello Raspberry...
I am who they say i am with a minimum
of seven spectacular names. I have lived for
so many years but there are still more days ahead.
My ideas are many and my dreams expand each night.
Knowing how long i have lived, you can imagine
the sizes of my dreams at the moment.
I can't even sleep with all those stack in my head.
I am an African. A proud one, of course.
The talking is too much.
Shut the hell up and stop typing like a typewritter.
Goodbye...
